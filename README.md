### Names not loading?
- Check that `names.json` is in the same directory

- Check browser console for errors

### Slow performance?
- Reduce batch size for faster initial results
- Use more specific filters to reduce dataset size

### Mobile issues?
- Ensure viewport meta tag is present
- Check touch target sizes (should be 44px+)
- Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
